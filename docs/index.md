# Welcome to PyAuto's documentation!

This is the documentation for PyAuto, a Python-based tool for autonomous driving.

Most contents for the moment are focused on control-and-planning-related topics.

More contents will be added in the future.

The contents are built with [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/), a static site generator that's geared towards project documentation, using the [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme.
